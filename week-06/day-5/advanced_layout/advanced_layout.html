            <main class="top-left">Mr. Speaker, for years, honest but unfortunate 
                consumers have had the ability to plead their case to come under 
                bankruptcy protection and have their reasonable and valid debts 
                discharged.</main>  
            <main class="top-right">The way the system is supposed to work, the bankruptcy 
                court evaluates various factors including income, assets and debt to 
                determine what debts can be paid and how consumers can get back on 
                their feet. Stand up for growth and opportunity. Pass this legislation.</main>  
            <main class="bottom-left">Truly rousing political speeches are, sadly,
                 few and far between. But those that are a little less inspiring can,
                  it turns out, be convincingly written by an artificial intelligence 
                  system. Yes, politicians may be a little like robots.</main>
