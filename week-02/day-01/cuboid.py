# Write a program that stores 3 sides of a cuboid as variables (doubles)
# The program should write the surface area and volume of the cuboid like:
# 
# Surface Area: 600
# Volume: 1000
a = 7
b = 4
c = 10
print("Surface Area: " + str(2 * ((a * b) + (b * c) + (a * c))))
print("Volume: " + str(a * b * c))
